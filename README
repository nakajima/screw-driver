= Screw.Driver =

Another way to run your Screw.Unit tests.

Still really early. To try it, run this:

  ./bin/screwdriver spec/fixtures/suite.html

You can specify a browser like so:

  ./bin/screwdriver spec/fixtures/suite.html --browser Safari

By default, Screw.Driver uses Firefox.

If you don't want the server to automatically quit after
your suite runs, you can use the "--server" option:

  ./bin/screwdriver spec/fixtures/suite.html --server

Screw.Driver will generate urls for each of the external
scripts and CSS links you include in your suite.html file,
and will serve them from the directory that contains the
suite.html file.
