= Screw.Driver =

Another way to run your Screw.Unit tests.

Still really early. To try it, run this:

  ruby lib/screw_driver.rb spec/fixtures/suite.html

Screw.Driver will generate urls for each of the external
scripts and CSS links you include in your suite.html file,
and will serve them from the directory that contains the
suite.html file.
