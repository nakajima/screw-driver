= Screw.Driver =

Another way to run your Screw.Unit tests.

Still really early. To try it, run this:

  ./bin/screwdriver spec/fixtures/suite.html

You can specify a browser like so:

  screwdriver spec/fixtures/suite.html --browser Safari

By default, Screw.Driver uses Firefox.

If you don't want the server to automatically quit after
your suite runs, you can use the "--server" option:

  screwdriver spec/fixtures/suite.html --server
  
Screw.Driver will generate urls for each of the external
scripts and CSS links you include in your suite.html file,
and will serve them from the directory that contains the
suite.html file.

== Using with Rails ==

If you're using Rails, run screwdriver from the root directory
of your app, and specify the "--rails" option. This will cause
the Screw.Driver server to serve the JavaScript files in your
public/javascripts directory. Example:

  screwdriver spec/fixtures/suite.html --rails

REQUIREMENTS
- sinatra
- colored
- hpricot

TODO
- Figure out why tests don't run properly from rake task.
- Support running without the colored gem
- Don't kill all Firefox tabs when complete
